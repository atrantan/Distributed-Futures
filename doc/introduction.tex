\chapter{Introduction}
We present an implementation of the future programming model for distributed memory,
using MPI-2's one-sided communication.


\section{Motivation}
Parallel computing has been mpla mpla mpla.
The two most dominant and widely used programming models are threads and message passing.
Threads are used on shared memory machines and require locking (error prone) while message
passing can be used on either shared or distributed memory. Describe message passing, say
its tough, talk about one sided communication, refer to ARMCI, ARMI, Charm++, Global address
space languages, MPI-2 etc.  Say that mpi is widely used and is implemented on most machines,
thus we want to check out its one sided interface, which has not received acceptance due to (?)
(check all that stuff I've read about how tought it is, mpla mpla).  Also need to mention the
future interface, and why we use it. Ease o programming, exposing irregular patterns(?).

Note:global arrays guys have already made arguments about one sided comm of mpi-2 

\section{Background}
\subsection{Futures}
Background on futures, mention languages that implement it as well as std and boost in C++.
Example code and explanation.
\subsection{MPI one-sided communication}
Maybe mention again thins from intro.  Explain the interface (windows, epochs, put, get).
Maybe a small example.

\section{Related Work}
RMI, RMC, HPX, STAPL's comm library
