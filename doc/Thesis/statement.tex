\section*{Statement}
\paragraph{}
This work has extended over two academic periods.  The first one stretches 
from the 15th of September to the 28th of February.  The second, from the
1st of March to the 30th of June.  During the first period, we developed the futures 
library we present in this report and had a first evaluation using microbenchmarks.
During the second period, we further evaluated our system's performance and added some
extra features like future serialization. 
As part of the
evaluation process, we developed our own version of the Tiled LU algorithm using futures.
Moreover, we also conducted a more detailed evaluation by profiling our rutnime
system.  A fair amount of time was also spent on fixing bugs in the library.
