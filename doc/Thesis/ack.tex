I want to thank my supervisor of this Master Thesis, prof. Joel Falcou for his support and guidance and of-course
for his great sense of humor. It has been a greate experience working with him. I also want to thank my 
other academic supervisors during this Master course, prof. Angelos Bilas and Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos along with 
Polyvios Pratikakis. They introduced me to parallel computing and languages and their trust and guidance has
inspired and enabled me to complete this work. I also want to thank Antoine Tran Tan for his help and cooperation during the
time I have been working on this Thesis. Finally, I want to express my sincere thanks and love to my family, all my
flatmates, in Greece and France alike, as well as my dearest friends for their support.
