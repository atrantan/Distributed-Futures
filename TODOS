*	NOTE: when calling async, user must be sure that arguments will be deducted correctly.
	Example: consider the functor is double->double, async(f, 1) will result in unregistered
	class, since when deserializing, it will consider a functor double->int.  Correct call
	to async here is either async(f, 1.0) or async(f, (double)1).
