* Implement scheduler (let's start with a round robin first)
* Handle more complex c++ objects (serialization of one sided comm interface)
* See if recursion is possible with any interface - It seems it's far from trivial
* async should be able to transfer data to worker from master (data=arguments)
* Handle different endianess on mpi version
* Maybe have some overloaded methods that infer default options (comm interface, data and type size etc)
* InterfaceComm implementations should keep their own namespace in order to implement utility functions, such as lock_and_get, etc
* FIXME:ARMCI original version seems to get stuck on some occassions...
