* FIXME:handle void return type
* FIXME:if functor takes more than 2 or 3 arguments like vector (probably for all dynamic containers),
				poping the task on worker causes a stack smash! 
				-workaround, create a struct/class to pack arguments (!remember to serialize it!)
* FIXME:Need to find a way to express argument types with CEREAL 

*	NOTE: when calling async, user must be sure that arguments will be deducted correctly.
	Example: consider the functor is double->double, async(f, 1) will result in unregistered
	class, since when deserializing, it will be considered as a functor double->int.  
	Correct call to async here is either async(f, 1.0) or async(f, (double)1).
