* See if recursion is possible with any interface - It seems it's far from trivial
* Possibly drop ARMCI,  does not seem to be mature enough to handle a higher level interface like ours
* Implement a sheduler factory class
* Find a way to delete array of objects...if you simply delete allocated data it causes an error in glibc
* Add exceptions
