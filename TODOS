* Implement std mutex interface for distributed enviroment (mpi, armci)
* Implement scheduler (let's start with a round robin first)
* Handle more complex c++ objects (serialization of one sided comm interface)
* Revise Makefile
* See if recursion is possible with any interface
* Maybe allows async to transfer data to worker from master (data=arguments)
* Handle different endianess on mpi version
* Maybe have some overloaded methods that infer default options (comm interface, data and type size etc)
* InterfaceComm implementations should keep their own namespace in order to implement utility functions, such as lock_and_get, etc
