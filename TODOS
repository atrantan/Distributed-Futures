* TODO:Add exceptions
* Find a way to delete array of objects...if you simply delete allocated data it causes an error in glibc
	- preferably the interface should not work with pointers, but with objects, in any case
		since we have support now, just leave it as is
* FIXME: memory leak with singleton classes, just remember to delete them at the end
* FIXME: specialize futures for void return type
* TODO: Maybe having multiple one-sided comms in the same "epoch" will be better for performance
* ISSUE: cannot use function pointers, since they cannot be serialized.  Maybe we could
	serialize an id or something and then reconstruct it on worker end.
* TODO: maybe change how termination works, have workers look their local variable
* ISSUE: crashes if run for 1 proc
